Requirement 1:
The first page is the home page that showcases each one of our products. I want each and every product to have a black ink stain appear behind them when hovered over! I also want a simple sfx to play when they're hovered over. 
Each menu link should have a simple yet scary visual effect, and each one should have its own eerie sound be faded in and faded out as the mouse hovers over and out of them.
Also, every page should have its respective menu link have a visual indicator that I'm in that page.

Requirement 2:
The second page is our biography, therefore I want the text to type itself, every character should produce a typewriter's keyboard's sound once typed. I want the fonts to be shaking a little.

Requirement 3: 
The third page is our products page!
I want every product card to react to clicks and hovers. I want a shadow effect to be cast around the frame when hovered, but not inside of it.
Every card should, once clicked, replace the frame, text, flower and perfume that are in full display, but I want it to be a quick yet suave transition from one to another. A fade-in-fade-out should be more than enough!
